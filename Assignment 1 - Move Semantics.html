You will implement 2 classes: the Inventory class and the Player class. The classes are outlined in Inventory.hpp and Player.hpp, and you will implement them in the files Inventory.cpp and Player.cpp, which you will create. Each class includes parameterized constructors, the "big five", and accessor and mutator methods.</p>
<p>The theme of this assignment is MMORPG characters, and the relation between the classes are structured as follows:<br>- <strong>Items</strong> are simple objects containing only a name, weight, and item type. You can see them in the files Item.cpp and Item.hpp, but you do not need to implement anything for the <strong>item</strong> class.<br>- <strong>Inventory</strong> contains a 2D vector of items, an item pointer, and some basic data types. Thus, <strong>item</strong> objects are nested within each <strong>inventory</strong> object.<br>- A <strong>player</strong> contains an <strong>inventory</strong> and a name. Thus there are two levels of nested objects inside each <strong>player</strong> object.<br>- A <strong>guild</strong> contains a vector of <strong>players</strong>, so it contains three levels of nested objects. You do not need to implement anything for the&nbsp;<strong>guild</strong> class, but you can use it to test moving <strong>players</strong>.<br>- To sum up, <strong>guilds</strong> contain <strong>players</strong> which contain <strong>inventories</strong> which contain <strong>items</strong>.</p>
<p>The only files you need to submit are Inventory.hpp, Inventory.cpp, Player.hpp, Player.cpp.<br>Do not alter Inventory.hpp and Player.hpp - submit them as is. Only write Inventory.cpp and Player.cpp.</p>
<p>Item.cpp, Item.hpp, Guild.cpp, Guild.hpp, and the makefile are included solely for your reference and convenience in testing. You do not need to alter or submit any of those files.</p>
<p>The project will be due Wednesday, February 26</p>

<p>Addendum 1:<br>In Inventory.hpp, line 38 uses the constructor,&nbsp;<em>std::vector(10, std::vector&lt;Item&gt;(10, Item{}))<br></em>By the C++ standard, this is a valid constructor, and it works on Gradescope and on other C++17 compilers we've tested.<br>If it's generating an error for you anyway, you may edit the file to explicitly declare the value type as follows:<br><em>std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;Item&gt;&gt;(10, std::vector&lt;Item&gt;(10, Item{}))</em></p>
<p>Addendum 2:<br>Keep in mind that while 2D arrays in C++ must be "rectangular", i.e. each row must be of the same size, 2D vectors may be a vector of differently-sized vectors.</p>
